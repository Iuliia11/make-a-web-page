          The world wide web is a collection of <em>HTML</em> (Hyper Text Markup Language) files. 
          HTML is a main type of a content which can be a plain text, images, music, videos etc.
          Each HTML document is linked to another one, 
          and they all together compose a web like it is.

          How it works:
          a user by means of computer runs a browser (EE/Chrome/Safari etc.),
          which makes a request to servers through the Internet.
          Servers are computers that host files that make up the web.
          The Internet turns to servers using <em> http protocols</em> (the main protocol of the web)
          and servers respond with files which user's browser displays.

          <li> text content <em>(what you see);</em> </li>

          HTML markup is made up of tags: <em> 'Opening tag' (in angle brackets) Content '/Closing tag' (in angle brackets). </em>
          Most of HTML tags come in pairs, but some of them are unpaired and called <em>void</em> (they don't have a content, so they don't need a closing tag, for example,'img' and 'br').

          <em>Inline</em> tags just end a line, and <em>block</em> tags make an ivisible box around the content.
          Block tags have height and width.
          The other one example of inline/block tags: 'span' is inline and 'div' is block.

          A branching structure which a browser builds called a "tree-like structure".
          It comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside them. This can be a text, or it can be another element.
          Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag. 
          <br><em>DOM (Document Oriented Model)</em> is a cross-plarform and language-independent convention

          The browser turns HML tags into elements that form a tree.

        Text Editors

        <p>
        A text editor is a program that helps you type text similar to document editors, 
        such as Microsoft Word or Corel WordPerfect, but without all the extra formatting functions that document editors have.
        The most popular text editors are <em>Codepen, Stratchpad and Sublime.</em>
        Strachpad has immediate feedback and great for beginner, but has only HTML and CSS. Codepen is great for code sharing 
        (you can just "copy-paste" code from Stratchpad to Codepen and share it), but requires an account. It has the following languages:
        HTML, CSS, Javascript. Sublime is difficult for beginners, but has a high proffesionalism and a variety of languages.

        Do not repeat yourself
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Avoiding repetition is very important for a programmer.
          <b>Do not repeat yourself</b> (DRY) is a principle of software development, aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds.
          When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements.
          If you do not keep on this principle, then every time you make some changes everywhere the repeated code appears, errors will arise.

        CSS
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          CSS stands for <em>Cascading Styles Sheets.</em> CSS is a style sheet language used for descibing the look and formatting 
          of a document written in a markup language. CSS allows you to use a specific syntax and rules how elemens look on the page,
          the size of the font, the color, background, borders, position etc. 
          <br> "Cascading" means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, 
          but also to all of those elements' child elements. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, 
          the more specific rule takes effect.
          <br>You can also think about CSS as a search and replace tool: you identify a class or a tag of the element you want to find 
          (or match, in CSS terminology), and then what you want to do with it, or what property values to replace with different ones.

        Order Matters
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          It also matters where you define the rules and in what order they are applied. Styles can be defined in different 
          places and are applied in the following order, with definitions further down the list overwriting previous definitions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li> the default style of a browser (different browsers have slightly different styles);</li>
          <li> stylesheet in a separate file (this is what you will be mostly using);</li>
          <li> stylesheet inside HTML (this can be done for small projects but is not ideal);</li>
          <li> inline style in an element (this can also be done but should be avoided).</li>

        Inheritance
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
         This is an important idea that is worth thinking about.<em> Inheritance</em> is a key feature in CSS, 
          it relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate. Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied 
          not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants.Descendant elements may inherit CSS property values from 
          any ancestor element enclosing them. In general, descendant elements inherit text-related properties, but box-related properties 
          are not inherited.
          <br> Inheritance prevents certain properties from being declared over and over again in a style sheet, allowing the software 
          developers to write less CSS.

        Styling up
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          In CSS you first write what's called a "selector". This defines what elements of the page a particular style will apply to.
          The following links will help you to understand CSS selectors:

          Comments are lines of text that the computer ignores. 
          They are just there so that programmers can leave notes for other people (or themselves) to read.
          In CSS, code comments begin with /* and end with */.

        Browsers
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
         Browsers use default stylesheets to determine how to display HTML elements. 
         You can view the default style rules for different elements for the following browsers:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>
            <a href=http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/WebCore/css/html.css> WebKit (Chrome and Safari)</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href=http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/layout/style/html.css> Firefox</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href=http://www.iecss.com/> Internet Explorer </a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because these rules differ sometimes between browsers, there are efforts to promote consistency 
          in styles across browsers. One popular solution to this issue is using what is referred to as a CSS reset such as
          <a href=http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/> normilize.css a
          </a>
          Browsers use default stylesheets to determine how to display HTML elements.

        Boxes
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          There are four main points about box sizing:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
          <li>
            HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components (content, padding, border and margin).
          </li>
          <li>
            Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues. 
            <ol>
              <li>
                Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels
              </li>
              <li>
                Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.

          </li>
          <li>
            Adding the rule 'display: flex;' to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.
